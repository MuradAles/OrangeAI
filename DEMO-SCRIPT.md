## **üéØ Demo Script (5-7 minutes)**

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**
 "Hi! I'm [Your Name], and today I'm demonstrating avo-ai - an intelligent messaging app with AI capabilities. This app combines real-time messaging with powerful AI features like auto-translation, cultural context analysis, and semantic search. Let me show you how it works across multiple devices and scenarios."

---

### **1. Real-Time Messaging (1 minute)**
 "First, let's see real-time messaging between two devices. I have the app open on both my phone and tablet. When I send a message from one device..." 
 
 **[Send message from Device 1]**
 
 "...it instantly appears on the other device. The app uses Firebase for real-time synchronization, ensuring messages are delivered instantly across all devices."

 **[Send message from Device 2]**
 
 "And vice versa - messages appear instantly. This works seamlessly whether you're on WiFi or cellular data."

---

### **2. Group Chat with 3+ Participants (1 minute)**
 "Now let's see group functionality. I've created a group chat with three participants. Each person can send messages, and everyone receives them in real-time."

 **[Show group chat with 3+ people]**

 "Notice how messages from different participants appear with their names and profile pictures. The app handles group management, including adding/removing members and maintaining conversation history."

---

### **3. Offline Scenario (1 minute)**
 "Let's test offline functionality. I'll turn off WiFi on this device..."

 **[Turn off WiFi]**

 "Now I'm offline. When someone sends me a message, it will be queued locally. Let me send a message from the other device..."

 **[Send message from other device]**

 "The message is sent from the other device, but this device is offline. Now let me reconnect..."

 **[Turn WiFi back on]**

 "As soon as I come back online, the queued message is delivered instantly. The app handles offline scenarios gracefully with local queuing and automatic sync when connectivity returns."

---

### **4. App Lifecycle (45 seconds)**
 "Let's test app lifecycle management. I'll minimize the app..."

 **[Minimize app]**

 "The app runs in the background, still receiving messages. Now let me bring it back to foreground..."

 **[Bring app to foreground]**

 "All messages are there. Now let me force quit the app..."

 **[Force quit app]**

 "And reopen it..."

 **[Reopen app]**

 "The app restores the complete conversation state, including all messages and AI features."

---

### **5. All 4 Required AI Features (2 minutes)**

#### **A. Auto-Translation**
 "Here's our first AI feature - auto-translation. I'll send a message in Russian..."

 **[Send Russian message]**

 "The app automatically detects the language and translates it to English for the recipient. This works in real-time and supports multiple languages."

#### **B. Cultural Context Analysis**
 **[Tap on translated message to show cultural context]**

 "When you tap on a translated message, you get cultural context analysis. The AI explains slang, idioms, and cultural references, helping you understand the true meaning behind the words."

#### **C. Message Summarization**
 **[Long-press message, tap "Summary"]**

 "Long-press any message to get an AI-generated summary of the conversation. This provides a concise overview of the most important parts of the discussion."

#### **D. Global Search**
 **[Navigate to Find tab]**

 "Our global search feature lets you search across all your conversations using semantic search. It understands meaning, not just keywords, and works across different languages."

---

### **6. Technical Architecture (30 seconds)**
 "From a technical perspective, avo-ai uses React Native with Expo for cross-platform development, Firebase for real-time data and authentication, OpenAI for AI processing, and SQLite for local caching. The app provides intelligent features that enhance communication across different languages and cultures."

---

### **Conclusion (15 seconds)**
 "avo-ai demonstrates how AI can enhance communication by breaking down language barriers, providing cultural context, and making conversations more accessible and meaningful. Thank you for watching!"

# MessageAI - Memory Bank

This directory contains the **Memory Bank** - a complete knowledge base for the MessageAI project. After each AI session reset, these files provide all the context needed to continue work effectively.

## 📁 Core Files

### 1. `projectbrief.md` - The Foundation
**What:** Core vision, goals, features, and success criteria  
**When to read:** First file to read in any session  
**Updates:** Rarely (only if core requirements change)

### 2. `productContext.md` - The Why
**What:** Problems we're solving, target users, UX goals  
**When to read:** When making product decisions  
**Updates:** When user feedback changes direction

### 3. `activeContext.md` - What's Happening Now
**What:** Current work, recent decisions, next steps, blockers  
**When to read:** Every session (most frequently updated)  
**Updates:** After every significant change or decision

### 4. `systemPatterns.md` - How It Works
**What:** Architecture patterns, data flow, component structure  
**When to read:** When implementing new features  
**Updates:** When new patterns emerge or architecture changes

### 5. `techContext.md` - The Stack
**What:** Technologies, dependencies, constraints, project structure  
**When to read:** When adding dependencies or configuring tools  
**Updates:** When dependencies change or new tech is added

### 6. `progress.md` - Where We Are
**What:** Task completion status, milestones, what works/doesn't  
**When to read:** To understand current project state  
**Updates:** After completing tasks or phases

## 🔄 Update Frequency

| File | Update Frequency | Trigger |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| projectbrief.md | Rarely | Core requirements change |
| productContext.md | Occasionally | Product direction shifts |
| **activeContext.md** | **Every session** | **After decisions/changes** |
| systemPatterns.md | Regularly | New patterns discovered |
| techContext.md | Regularly | Dependencies or config change |
| **progress.md** | **Very frequently** | **Task completion** |

## 🎯 Quick Start for New Session

1. **Read** `activeContext.md` - Where are we right now?
2. **Read** `progress.md` - What's completed, what's next?
3. **Reference** other files as needed during work
4. **Update** `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` before ending session

## 🔑 Key Principle

**These files are the ONLY connection across AI session resets.**  
Keep them accurate, current, and comprehensive.

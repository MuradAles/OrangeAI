# Active Context

## Current Status: **Presence System Optimized! 🚀**

### Where We Are
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete:** Foundation, auth, theme, database, UI components all working
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete:** Core messaging with real-time updates, virtual scrolling, and optimistic updates
- ✅ **Phase 3 Partially Complete:** Images, reactions, typing, presence (optimized), contacts, friend requests working
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure:** Jest + React Native Testing Library with 88 passing tests

### Current Task
**Just Completed: Presence System Optimization & Bug Fixes 🔧**

We've built the complete one-on-one messaging system with:
- Real-time chat list with FlashList virtual scrolling
- Full-screen chat modal with message bubbles
- Optimistic updates (messages appear instantly)
- Message status tracking (sending → sent → delivered → read)
- Jump to bottom floating button
- Load from SQLite first (<100ms), then sync from Firebase
- Message grouping, date separators, character counter
- User profile caching for chat participants

### Recent Work (This Session)

#### ✅ Completed: Presence System Optimization & Bug Fixes

**What We Fixed:**

1. **Centralized Presence Management** (`src/store/PresenceStore.ts` - NEW)
   - Created dedicated Zustand store for global presence state
   - Eliminated duplicate subscriptions (was 3x per user, now 1x per user)
   - Added version counter to force React re-renders when Map changes
   - Proper cleanup lifecycle management

2. **UI Reactivity Issues Fixed**
   - Online indicators now update instantly (<1 second)
   - Added `presenceVersion` counter that increments on every presence change
   - Components subscribe to `presenceVersion` for reactivity
   - `FlatList`/`FlashList` use `extraData={presenceVersion}` to trigger re-renders
   - Fixed Zustand not detecting Map content changes

3. **Performance Optimization** (95% cost reduction!)
   - **Removed expensive 30-second heartbeat** (was 120 writes/hour per user)
   - Now uses app state changes only (~5 writes/hour per user)
   - Better battery life, lower Firebase costs
   - Same reliability via `.onDisconnect()`

4. **Sign-Out Navigation Fixed**
   - Removed duplicate `router.replace()` calls in profile.tsx
   - `_layout.tsx` now handles all navigation based on `isAuthenticated`
   - No more race conditions or "stuck" states

5. **Permission Errors Eliminated**
   - Cleanup presence subscriptions BEFORE Firebase sign-out
   - AuthStore.signOut() now calls `PresenceStore.cleanup()` first
   - No more `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors after logout
   - Added guards to prevent presence updates when not authenticated

6. **"No Profile Found" Warning Suppressed**
   - Only show warning if user object exists but profile is incomplete
   - Normal sign-in flow is now silent (no unnecessary warnings)
   - Profile loads immediately after authentication

7. **Component Updates**
   - `app/(tabs)/friends.tsx`: Uses PresenceStore, optimized dependencies
   - `app/(tabs)/home.tsx`: Uses PresenceStore, optimized dependencies
   - `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`: Fixed sign-out, removed manual navigation
   - `src/features/chat/components/ChatModal.tsx`: Uses PresenceStore
   - `app/_layout.tsx`: Removed heartbeat, improved presence lifecycle

**Performance Impact:**
- **Cost Savings:** 95% reduction in Firebase Realtime Database writes
- **Latency:** Online indicators update in <1 second for normal app usage
- **Battery:** No constant background polling
- **UX:** Instant visual feedback on presence changes

**Architecture Changes:**
- Presence logic: Distributed across 3 files → Centralized in PresenceStore
- Subscriptions: Per-component → Global with deduplication
- Updates: Heartbeat-based (30s) → Event-based (app state changes)
- State: Direct mutation → Immutable with version counter
- Navigation: Manual routing → Automatic based on auth state

- ✅ Chat auto-creation on friend request acceptance
- ✅ Real-time username search
- ✅ Proper cleanup with unsubscribe on unmount
- ✅ Avatar circles display correctly
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh for manual updates

### Recent Decisions

#### Real-Time Listeners vs One-Time Fetches
**Decision:** Use Firestore `onSnapshot()` for real-time friend request updates  
**Reasoning:**
- Instant UI updates when requests change
- Better user experience (no manual refresh needed)
- Push-based updates more efficient than polling
- Firestore handles connection management automatically
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

**Implementation:**
- `subscribeFriendRequests()` - Incoming requests listener
- `subscribeSentFriendRequests()` - Sent requests listener
- Store unsubscribe functions in Zustand store
- Call `unsubscribeAll()` on component unmount

#### Firestore Security Rules for Batch Writes
**Issue:** Batch writes failed because rules tried to `get()` documents being created  
**Solution:** Simplified participant rules to validate data without reading parent documents  
**Result:** Friend acceptance now works with atomic batch writes

### Next Immediate Steps

**Option A: Add Push Notifications (Task 3.11) - Recommended Next**
1. Set up FCM in Firebase Console
2. Install `expo-notifications` (already installed ✅)
3. Create `NotificationService`
4. Send notifications for:
   - New messages
   - Friend requests
   - Friend request accepted
5. Handle notification taps (deep linking)

**Option B: Add Image Sharing (Task 3.1)**
1. Install image dependencies (already installed: expo-image, expo-image-picker, expo-image-manipulator ✅)
2. Create `StorageService` for Firebase Storage uploads
3. Add image compression (85% quality, max 10MB)
4. Generate thumbnails (200x200px)
5. Update MessageInput to support image picker
6. Update MessageBubble to display images

**Option C: Implement Message Actions (Tasks 3.3-3.5)**
1. Implement "Copy" action (copy text to clipboard)
2. Implement "Delete for me" action
3. Implement "Delete for everyone" action
4. Implement reaction picker (emoji keyboard)
5. Add reaction button to long-press menu

**Option D: Test Complete Flow End-to-End**
1. Test auth flow (sign up, create profile, sign in)
2. Test friend request flow (search, send, accept, chat created)
3. Test messaging flow (send, receive, status updates)
4. Verify optimistic updates work correctly
5. Verify SQLite caching works offline
6. Test on multiple devices for real-time sync

### Active Considerations

#### Chat Creation on Friend Accept
- ✅ Chat document created in `/chats/{chatId}`
- ✅ Participant subcollection documents created for both users
- ✅ Contact subcollection updated for both users
- ✅ Uses batched writes for atomicity
- ⚠️ Need to verify in actual testing

#### Firestore Architecture Decisions
**Contacts & Blocked Users: Subcollections**
- `/users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}` stores `{ userId, addedAt }`
- `/users/{userId}/blockedUsers/{blockedUserId}` stores `{ userId, blockedAt }`
- Easier to query and manage
- Clear ownership model

**Participants: Subcollection**
- `/chats/{chatId}/participants/{userId}` stores full participant data
- Allows per-user chat settings (notifications, archived, etc.)
- Simplifies querying user's chats

#### Message Architecture (for PR #2)
- Messages will be in `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}` subcollection
- SQLite will cache last 200 messages per chat
- Pagination will load older messages from Firestore
- Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback

### Open Questions

**Q: Should we add push notifications now or after messaging?**
- **Pro for now:** Friend requests need notifications
- **Pro for later:** Can test notifications for messages too
- **Decision:** User preference (either works)

**Q: Need to verify security rules for messages?**
- Will need rules for `/chats/{chatId}/messages/` subcollection
- Only chat participants should read/write messages
- Can add when building PR #2

### Blockers

**None** - All systems operational ✅

### Focus for Next Work

**Recommendation: Add Push Notifications (Task 3.11)**

This is the most logical next step because:
1. ✅ Core messaging is complete (PR #2)
2. ✅ Friend request system is complete
3. ✅ Users can chat in real-time
4. 📱 Need notifications for:
   - New messages (critical for user engagement)
   - Friend requests
   - Friend request accepted
5. Dependencies already installed (`expo-notifications`)

**Alternative: Test Complete Flow First (Option D)**
Before adding more features, we could test the complete user journey end-to-end to ensure everything works correctly on actual devices.
